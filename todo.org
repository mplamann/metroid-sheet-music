* Lilypad emacs improvements
** Fix indentation
   TAB should do something reasonable
   Maybe a chance to play with tree-sitter?
** Easy insert of chords
   Something is screwy with [s>] in evil-surround, but in any case there should
   be easy syntax for inserting chords
** Electric brackets
   Don't make me enter } manually
** Adjust syntax table to count ' and , as word characters
